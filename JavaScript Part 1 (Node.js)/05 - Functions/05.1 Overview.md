# Functions Overview

### What is a function?

A *function* is a reusable block of code that performs a task. Functions run when they are called on. The term "method" is used synonymously with function in JavaScript. That said, a method typically refers to a function that is tied to an object, whereas standalone functions are just called functions. 

We have used many methods that are built into Math and String objects. Now, our goal is to write our own functions that perform specific tasks. 

### Syntax and Function Declaration

The first step to creating a function is **function declaration**. To create a function, we use the keyword ```function``` followed by a unique name. Function names should start with lowercase letters, and utilize *camelCasing* for easy readability. 

The following code segment declares a new function called *printMessage*.

```javascript
//Function declaration
function printMessage(){

}
```
