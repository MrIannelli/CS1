# Template Strings

### Syntax and Useage

A **template literal**, commonly referred to as a **template string**, is a special string that is written in backtick characters ```(``)``` rather than double quotes. Along with having normal characters, template strings can also contain other parts called **placeholders**, which are embedded expressions delimited by a dollar sign and curly braces: ```${expression}```. 

Inside the ```expression```, we can put a variable or another full expression (addition of numbers, concatenation, etc). The value of the expression will be concatenated into the string, replacing the ```${expression}```. Here is an example.

```javascript
// Create variables
let firstName = "Jeramie";
let age = 38;

// Create a template string message
let message = `Hello, ${firstName}. You are ${age} years old.`;

// Print the message to the console
console.log(message);
```

Running this code will print the following messages to the console.

```
Hello, Jeramie. You are 38 years old.
```

Note that we can use any **excape sequences** ```\n, \t,``` in our template strings as well. We also can use double quotes ```"``` in template literals without an escape sequence.

```javascript
// Create variables
let firstName = "Jeramie";
let age = 38;

// Create a template string message
let message = `Your name is, "${firstName}".\n\nYou are ${age} years old.`;

// Print the message to the console
console.log(message);
```

Running this code will print the following messages to the console.

```
Your name is "Jeramie". 

You are 38 years old.
```


### Wrap Up
Template strings are very useful for creating complex strings that have a lot of special characters or concatenation. They are unique to JavaScript.
