# Parsing Data

### What is Parsing?

*Parsing* is the process of converting a piece of string data into a piece of numerical data. In order to parse a string, the value of the string must be able to be read as a number in order to be parsed. For example, the string ```"16"``` can be parsed into a number, since the characters 1 and 6 are part of a number. However, the string ```"cheese"``` cannot be parsed since the characters of the string cannot be read as numerical characters. 

### Parsing Methods

There are two methods that are used to parse in JavaScript - the ```parseInt()``` method and the ```parseFloat()``` method.

* ```parseInt(value)```: The **value** argument will be converted into an integer. 
  
* ```parseFloat(value)```: The **value** argument will be converted into a floating-point number. 

We have options on how to use the converted data in our program. We can parse the data into a literal number (which is not saved to a variable), we can save the converted data to a new variable, or we can overwrite the string data of the original variable with the numeric version. Examples of these are shown below.

```javascript
//Create a prompt
const prompt = require('prompt-sync')();

//Take in data
let userInput = prompt("Enter a number: ");

//We can convert the string to a number and store it in a new variable...
let userInputInt = parseInt(userInput);
console.log("The product of "+userInputInt+" and 3 is: "+(userInputInt*3));

//We can parse during a calculation to convert a string to a literal number value 
console.log("The product of "+userInputInt+" and 3 is: "+(parseInt(userInput)*3));

//We can parse an input right after we take it, which will immediately convert the input to a number
let gpa = parseFloat(prompt("Enter your GPA: "));
console.log("Let's change that GPA...your new GPA is: "+(gpa+1.0));

//We can overwrite the original string data with the numeric version
let age = prompt("What is your age? ");
age = parseInt(age);
console.log("In 10 years, you will be "+(age+10)+" years old. Wow.");
```

### Wrap Up

We must always be aware of what kind of numbers we want to work with. Some numbers are suited to be integers: a person's age, a number of dice to roll, etc. Other numbers are suited to be floating-point numbers: a gpa, a weight, an average score, etc.
