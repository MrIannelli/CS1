# Parsing Data

### What is Parsing?

*Parsing* is the process of converting a piece of string data into a piece of numerical data. In order to parse a string, the value of the string must be able to be read as a number in order to be parsed. For example, the string ```"16"``` can be parsed into a number, since the characters 1 and 6 are part of a number. However, the string ```"cheese"``` cannot be parsed since the characters of the string cannot be read as numerical characters. 

### Parsing Methods

There are two methods that are used to parse in JavaScript - the ```parseInt()``` method and the ```parseFloat()``` method.

* ```parseInt(value)```: The **value** argument will be converted into an integer. 
  
* ```parseFloat(value)```: The **value** argument will be converted into a floating-point number. 

Notice that we need to use variables to save the converted data. We have options to do this.
